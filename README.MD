# Project Details and Requirements

This project required me to use more advanced concepts of HTML and CSS by creating a personal blog about myself.
I dedicated this one to places I've visited and or plan to visit in the near future.

## HTML
In the HTML I used best practices at the time of the project and using the `div` and `section` tags to create seperate bodies.
**Example:**
```html
  <section>
    <div>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
    </div>
</section>```
This allowed me to create a `grid` to set base to transform the website

## CSS
The CSS files entail a lot `display: grid` allowing the website to be responsive to all screen sizes.
By changing the background color for each size (Mobile, Tablet, and Computer)It shows the website functionality
Additional CSS properties added included border radius for `button` and including hover elements to change with mouse placement
